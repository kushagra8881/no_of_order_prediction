# no_of_order_prediction


## Introduction

Welcome to our "Number of Orders Prediction" project! Our main goal is to create a robust machine learning model that can accurately forecast the number of orders in various scenarios. This predictive tool can enable businesses to make informed decisions, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

To capture the complexity of order prediction, our model takes into account the following features:

- Store ID
- Store Type
- Location Type
- Region Code
- Date
- Holiday
- Discount

These features provide valuable insights into the context surrounding each order, allowing our model to learn and predict effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To experiment with the model, ensure you have the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
